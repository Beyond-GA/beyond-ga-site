This README will be updated with better instructions soon. For now, you can clone the repo using your SSH key, and follow the instructions below to make sure you have gatsby installed.

## Clone the Repo!

1. Clone the branch using an SSH Key using the "Clone or Download" button on this page, and make sure to copy the link for the SSH Key.
2. Open command line and navigate to whatever folder you want this repo to live in on your computer. Then type:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
3. Press enter. Great job! 


Beyond-GA uses the default Gatsby starter. For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Install Gatsby 

1. Navigate into the Beyond-Ga-Site folder. For all of these steps, make sure you are in the "beyond-ga-site" folder in your command line:
```sh
cd beyond-ga-site
```

2. Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

3. Run npm install.
```sh 
npm install
```

4. Now you can run the project locally on your computer! 
```sh 
gatsby develop
```


## Create Your Own Branch!

1. Go into terminal and navigate to the beyond-ga repo on your computer.  

2. 
```sh
$ git branch 
```
will tell you what branches you have, and what branch you are currently on.  The branch you are in currently will be starred like this:
```sh
* annmaries-branch
master
```
3. Create a new branch with your name, like "annmaries-branch".To create a new branch, type 
```sh
$ git branch annmaries-branch
```
and then you'll have a new branch called annmaries-branch

4. To switch to a different branch,  type 
```sh
$ git checkout annmaries-branch
```
